# Breville Joule HACS Plugin
rudimentary integration for the Breville Joule Turbo for Home Asisstant + HACS

you need to have a "normal" password set. If you created your account with google, type in your email and press forgot password to set a pw.

### config
```yaml
breville_joule:
  username: '<your email>'
  password: '<your pw>'
```

sorry, but the code quality is really bad :D

some LLMs had to suffer during the creation of this plugin
